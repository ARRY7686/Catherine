### Catherine - A Basic Chess Engine

Catherine is an open-source chess engine written in C++. This project is primarily for learning purposes, aimed at exploring chess programming concepts such as move generation, evaluation functions, and game tree search algorithms.

## Features (Planned)

- Basic move generation and validation

- Simple evaluation function for board positions

- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making

- Command-line interface (CLI) for playing against the engine

- Potential integration with graphical interfaces in the future
